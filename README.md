# Installing ERS Onto a Car
1. Copy the mod .zip you wish to add ERS to into the same folder as `ApplyErs.ps1`
2. Shift + right click in the file explorer to open a PowerShell in the same folder as `ApplyErs.ps1`
3. Run `.\ApplyErs.ps1 <name of zip file>`

This creates a copy of the mod, but with the ERS installed. Simply install that mod into BeamNG.drive as you would with any other mod.

# Usage
## UI App
Included in the generated car is an UI app that displays basic information about the ERS.

## Key Bindings
The ERS has three deployment modes: Conservative, Power, and Off. You can switch between these by binding a key to `ERS: Cycle Strategy`
Additionally, you can force the ERS to run at full power until you press the brakes by binding a key to `ERS: Force Overtake Mode` and pressing that key.
